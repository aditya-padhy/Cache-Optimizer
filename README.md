# File System Cache Optimizer

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing different approaches designed to improve the efficiency of file system
operations by optimizing the use of the file system cache. The cache is an in-memory buffer that temporarily
holds frequently accessed file data, minimizing disk I/O operations, which are generally slower than memory
access.
